# AgriSight
AgriSight uses satellite imagery to provide findings on crop health and land use, helping humanitarian organizations and local cooperatives make informed decisions to address food insecurity in conflict-affected regions.

The preliminary focus is to provide insights based of DRC's North Kivu and South Kivu provinces using geospatial data and API by Google Earth Engine, and EU's SentilHub (Which exposes satellite images data fron Sentinel 1 and 2 Satellites).

The google earth engine code so farm it accessible via this Google collab notebook : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JNhpqK8AP7oi6sYQ0-Kq2VX6MEiwqXf8?usp=sharing.
Alternatively, the code of this same notebook can be seen in the googlearthengine folder.

On the other hand, SentinelHub was also explored, and the details can be found in the sentinelhub folder, alongside its README file and all authentification details.
